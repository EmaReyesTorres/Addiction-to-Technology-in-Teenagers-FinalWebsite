  <h3>Technology is a tool that, when used responsibly, can bring significant benefits in areas such as information transfer and acquisition, communication, work, learning and leisure. It also serves as a tool to improve the access of specific groups to specific cultural and social values.</h3>

<h2><u>New technologies and the risks of their use</u></h2>
  
<h3>However, the misuse and abuse of new technologies causes the opposite effect to that desired, involving the following risks:</h3>
  
  <h4>○ Going from information to overstimulation and inhibition where the person becomes capable of processing so much information</h4>

  <h4>○ Communication change by social isolation</h4>

  <h4> ○ Going from knowledge of realities to creating a virtual world of fiction and confusion</h4>

  <h4>○ Have learning difficulties, especially in reading and writing</h4>

  <h4>○ Change leisure for the abandonment of school, work and/or family obligations</h4>

  <h3>In the case of adolescence, there is a higher risk of misusing and abusing them, as a consequence of having low self-esteem and being in a risky family situation that can range from lack of family communication to lack of trust from parents to adolescents. Likewise, it is a complicated stage due to the difficulty of accepting one's own body image, as well as belonging to a group and being constantly subjected to the pressure exerted by it.</h3>
